        "Ans1- Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python is designed to emphasize code readability with its clean syntax that allows developers to write fewer lines of code compared to many other programming languages.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans2-An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line, rather than compiling the entire program into machine code before execution. It translates high-level Python code into a form that the computer can understand and execute directly.\n",

        "Ans4-No, you cannot use a keyword as a variable name in Python. Keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the Python language and are used for specific purposes in the syntax (e.g., defining loops, conditions, functions, etc.). Allowing keywords as variable names would cause ambiguity and errors in the code\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans5-Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it has been created. In simple terms, if an objectâ€™s state or content can be changed after its creation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans11- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to enable decision-making in a program. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met. This is essential for creating dynamic and interactive programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans12- 1.The program evaluates the conditions in the if block first.\n",
        "2.If the if condition is False, the program moves to the first elif condition.\n",
        "3.If the elif condition is True, its corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest of the elif and else blocks are skipped.\n",
